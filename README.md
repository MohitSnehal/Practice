# Practice
This repository is a compilation of all the algorithms, data structures and competitive coding questions that I have implemented. 
This is just for book-keeping and should not be used by others for copying solutions. Please try to understand my solutuions and implement it on your own.
Note : 
1. All the programs are in Java 8
2. This is a simple directory with solutions of various problems from various platforms.
3. Some solutions might not be correct because of partial submissions.
